# Rules for writting concurrent boolean program #
- global variable 'atomic' must be declared first
- init always the first function
- In init function, 'atomic' must be set to F
- always use assume(T) at the end of each thread
- Every non-thread function must have return
- A non-thread function is function with name:
    + Different from 'init' and 'main'
    + Not begin with 'thread' (in any mixed case)
